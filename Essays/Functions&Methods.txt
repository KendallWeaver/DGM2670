Functions/Methods will take in information and will return values or any kind of information that the code recognizes.
The one exception are void functions; they do not return a value.

Functions must be given a date type, which reflects the kind of value that the function will return.
If you want a function to "work", you must call it somehow in the code in order for it to work. \
