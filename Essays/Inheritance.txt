Inheritance is vital to Object oriented programming. The "parent" is the base class, and the "child" is the inherit class.
Anything in the parent class will be able to be accessed by the child class, but the parent won't be able to access classes
in the child class.

The three accecss modifiers you should be concerned about are public, protected, and private. Similarly to what you learned
before, public variables will be accessable by a child class.
Protected is interesting as it is able to be accessed by the child class, but it cannot be accessed outside of the two classes.

Your scripts will inherit from MonoBehavior, especially since a lot of parameters like GameObject and transform will be able 
to be accessed.

Inhertiance amongst scripts is similar to a heirarchial system.
