Arrays can store data together that the same type, like integers or strings.
After the type, you need to use brackets. Next is the name of the array, 
and it will equal a new type with the number of elements that will be in that array in brackets.
The index of the element starts at zero.
You must initialize your array, which can be done in the start function, or
when you're setting your array in the global area, equal it to {some, kind, of, values}.
(yes I'm stretching a bit).
You can use unity to store Game Objects into arrays. Arrays can also be accessed in loops.

To use lists, you will need to add Systems.Collections.Generic at the beginning of your code.
According to the video, a list "is the generic class". You will need to put the class name after the modifiers, and then a type.

You must add to the list with using the .Add. You can access the list similarly to how you do an array.
Lists can be altered manually with functions.

Lists are used instead of an array when more functionality is required.
