The syntax is the structure of the language, and conventions are important to read and create the code. 
It works in a heirarchical system. In the dot operator, the first word is like a general subject, then the dot incidates something from within that general subject.
The semicolon in C# will indicate when a line of code will end. This is usually used for basic lines of codes, but for some cases, like methods and statements, a semicolon is not needed.

Other forms of syntax are indenting (which is usually done automatically; there are cases where you're own personal indentation is necessary) and comments.
