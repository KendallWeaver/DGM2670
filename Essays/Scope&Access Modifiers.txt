Scope is the area where a variable can be used. Brackets are a good indicator where a variable is located.
If a variable is within the class but not in a function, it's a global variable within the class. Inside a function it is local to that function.
The video puts it in terms of a variable outside of a function being in the scope of the class, and the variables in the function are in scope in a function.

Public modifiers can be accessed outside of the class, while private can only be accessed within the class.

Public variables can be accessed in the inspector and can be changed accordingly. This can be useful if you're trying to find the right value you're looking
for while playing. However, if you create a default value in the start function, it will reset to that. Even so, after the start function has been initialized,
you can then change the value.

If you initialize another class in a separate script, that script can now access the public variables in the other script, as long as they are called properly.
