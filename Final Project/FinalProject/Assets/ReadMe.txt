This is a game that is played entirely in the console. Yes, it's a text-based adventure game.
Do not have the Game Window in unity go full screen; it will be very difficult to play.
Make sure that the "Collapse" button in the console window is unchecked.
Enabling the "Clear On Play" button on in the console window will help replay the game much easier.
